# react-snap action

This action uses [react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap) to pre-render a web application into static, hydratable HTML.

If your node-based web application has a `build` script that outputs HTML, this action will render it and update the `index.html` within output directory with the result. This can then easily be deployed to GitHub pages etc and you'll have some of the benefits of SSR without needing a server!
